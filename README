This project is an ongoing example of how to implement a specification for a program and gradually incorporate Object Oriented principles.

At each step a new UML diagram will be generated to describe the state of the program as is, alongside a general explanation of what decisions were made and why.

Version 1 is an example of this project done by using a single class.

Version 2 creates a Class architecture, adapting the version 1 Class into several packages to achieve a more Object Oriented design.

Version 3 further adapts the project to enforce a Model View Controller architecture on the previously redesigned project.

This project is meant to be a supplemental learning tool for Object Oriented Design (Comp-3721) at Mount Allison University for the Fall semester of 2020.

All work here is done by Ada Clevinger and overseen by the class' professor, Dr. Ricker.

Please feel free to reach out to Ada if you have questions about this, she will try to get back to you as is convenient.

The Problem Statement:
"This application will support the operations of a technical library for an R&D organization.
This includes the searching for and lending of technical library materials, including books, DVDs, and technical journals.
Users will enter their company ids in order to use the system; and they will enter material ID numbers when checking out and returning items.

Each borrower can be lent up to five items.
Each type of library item can be lent for a different period of time (books 4 weeks, journals 2 weeks, DVDs 1 week).
If returned after their due date, the library user's organization will be charged a fine, based on the type of item (books $1/day, journals $3/day, DVDs $5/day).

Materials will be lent to employees with no overdue items, fewer than five articles out, and total fines less than $100."

This problem statement is taken from a class example from the 2018 Fall Comp-3721 class that Ada took during her undergrad.
